# DataStructuresAlgs
This package offers a collection of data structures and algorithms written in Swift.
This includes well-known data structures and algorithms such as Djikstra's shortest path algorithm, as well as algorithms for specific problems such as checking whether a string contains all unique characters.

Each data structures and algorithm class also has a corresponding unit test with, if applicable, a link to test data/further decription.

## Licence
